# Bookmarks-Slideshow
Qlik Sense extension that sets in motion a slideshow of bookmarks across one or multiple sheets

This can be useful on a large flat screen TV in the middle of the office running through important metrics relevant to the employees there, as well as for marketing events and workshops.

How It Works:
After selecting the refresh interval and what bookmarks and sheets you'd like the slideshow to run through, you can press the button and it will start running through the selections/sheets dynamically in a smooth manner. To stop the slideshow, simply refresh the page.
